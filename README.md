# loadgen
Library to simulate real-time load for multiple APIs of a service. I haven't spent effort to document the library yet. Examples in this repo will be a good start to use this library.

Features
- Scheduled increase of load
- Weighted and randomized load to target multiple APIs
- HTTP endpoints to tune load in runtime
- Prometheus metrics
